# mySQL-DBMS
Created a mySQL database for a Hospital DBMS academic project (Database Management Systems and Design course, Rutgers Spring 2020). Database functionality includes: functions/queries that utilized inserting, deleting, or updating patient records, calculations made with built-in aggregate functions, and where/group by queries.
Functions/queries utilized included inserting, deleting, or updating patient records, making calculations with built-in aggregate functions, and where/group by queries to better sort data.
Also included a screenshot of my EER diagram from the mySQL workbench.
